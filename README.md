# Send to Feedbin

Send pages to Feedbin to read later from Edge (Chromium).


## Installing

Maybe someday I'll put this in the extension store but for now you can just sideload it:

1. Clone or download the repo and extract it somewhere permanent, like your Documents or something.
2. Go to [edge://extensions/](edge://extensions/) and enable Developer Mode.
3. Click on "Load unpacked" near the top and choose the repo directory.
4. Once you have the Feedbin icon in your menu bar, click on it and it'll give you a button to configure the token.
5. Follow those instructions to configure your token.
6. Whenever you want to save a page, just click on the Feedbin button.


## Notes

All code is available under MIT License.

I'm not affiliated with Feedbin in any way; I just like their service and wanted to send pages using an extension rather than a bookmarklet because I don't use bookmark bars.
